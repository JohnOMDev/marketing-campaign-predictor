README: Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions

Overview:

This repository contains code and resources for predicting term deposit subscriptions based on direct marketing campaign data from a credit institution. The goal is to implement machine learning models to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, leveraging various features provided in the dataset.

Sections:

	1.	Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
	•	Explore the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.
	•	Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
	•	Justify the selection of variables and preprocessing techniques based on their relevance to the prediction task.
	2.	Model Implementation and Evaluation:
	•	Implement machine learning models to predict term deposit subscriptions.
	•	Experiment with different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
	•	Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics and compare results across different algorithms.
	•	Provide clear justifications for the choice of models, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.
	3.	Conclusion and Recommendations:
	•	Summarize the findings from model evaluation and selection.
	•	Provide insights into the most influential features and potential areas for further analysis or improvement.
	•	Conclude with recommendations for deploying the selected model in real-world scenarios.

Dataset:

	•	The dataset contains various attributes such as age, job type, marital status, education, and contact communication type, among others.
	•	The target variable, ‘y’, indicates whether the client has subscribed to a term deposit.
	•	Ensure thorough understanding of the dataset and its implications on the prediction task.

Dependencies:

	•	This project requires Python and relevant libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
	•	Make sure all dependencies are installed before running the code.
